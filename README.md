# Triathlon calendar

A web page to help you decide how to schedule your training load for the next triathlon.
Currently is only which days, eventually I will add workouts to make this a full traing plan calculator.

# Getting setup
After you clone the code to your local enviornment using git clone, run "npm install" and then you should be able to run "npm run build" and then "npm start" and you can go to localhost:3000 to see the local version. For development enviornment I would recommend VS Code with it's inbuilt terminals and extensions plus it's free. 

# Adding to the repo

1. Create branch and name it something unique
2. Make your changes
3. Run it locally 'npm run build'
4. Manual testing to make sure nothing broke 'npm run start'
5. Push you branch (can be done anytime after 1.)
6. Create an MR
7. Once approved, merge it into main
8. Pull latest main
9. Run locally and do manual testing
10. Run git deploy
